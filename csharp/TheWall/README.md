# The Wall Using ASP.NET

- This project consists of a simple messaging board for users to exchange posts and comments.

- Fully functional login/registration system for users (uses hashed password matching and email for authentication).

- Posting new content restricted for page viewers who are not logged in.

- Uses ASP.NET Core 2.0 MVC with mySQL database backend (SQL files available under Models > SQL).

- Customizable CSS logo and provided default favicon.

- Optimized for viewing on all screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and mobile.

- Styled using the Materialize CSS framework and jQuery.

### Known Issues
- Unused dependencies
- Needs code refactoring
- New messages and comments require refreshing view
- Session limitations
- Logout requires extra button click

### Future Ideas
- Add AJAX
- Titles for posts
- Build system to handle user permissions
- Speech-to-text posting
- Ability for users to post richly formatted text including code snippets
