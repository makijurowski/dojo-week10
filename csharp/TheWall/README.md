# The Wall Using ASP.NET

- This project consists of a simple messaging board for users to exchange posts and comments.

- Fully functional login/registration system for users (uses email).

- Content restricted for page viewers who are not logged in.

- Uses ASP.NET Core 2.0 MVC with mySQL database backend (SQL files available under Models > SQL).

- Customizable CSS logo and generated favicon.

### Known Issues

### Future Ideas
- Add AJAX
- Titles for posts
- Build system to handle user permissions
